    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Facebook Connect, Game Center, and Google+:</u> You may be able to
      log in to our Services using sign-in services (“Social Login”) such as
      Facebook Connect, Apple’s Game Center, or an Open ID provider. These
      third party Social Login platforms will authenticate your identity and
      provide you the option to share certain personal information with us
      such as your name or email address to pre-populate our sign up form.
      Social Login platforms like Facebook Connect give you the option to post
      information about your activities on our Services to your profile page

    </p>
    <p>
      We may collect and record information through the relevant Social Login

    <p>
      <span class="bold">Information Collected Automatically</span>: When you

      data, standard sever log information, your connections and interactions
      with other users, purchase histories with us and social media data (if
      you have linked your account and in accordance with your sharing
      permissions). We (or the third parties we work with) use standard
      tracking technologies (like log files, software development kits (SDKs)
      and web beacons) to do this. In addition, we or our partners may also
      use tracking technologies and advertising IDs to serve personalized ads
      to you in our Services. Please see the section below relating to
      Tracking Technologies [INSERT LINK TO COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
      SECTION] for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Mobile Platforms:</u> When you play or otherwise use any of our
      mobile games or applications, we or third party partners will collect
      and process certain information about you, including your unique device
      ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, device maker, media
      access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity
      (“IMEI”), the type and version of your operating system (“OS”), language
      of the OS, your unique device ID, your time zone, the screen size of
      your device, mobile device Advertising ID (known as “IDFA” for iOS
      devices, or “Android Advertising ID” for Android devices), your general
      geolocation information (city/country based on your Internet Protocol
      (“IP”) address) and your email address (if you have connected to
      Facebook or Google+). This information is useful to us for
      troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends so that we can
      improve and personalize the Services for our users. Device identifier /
      information such as device type, hardware model, device maker, device
      operating system and its language or other technical data like screen
      size, or combination of this data, is also collected and used to
      determine device compatibility and optimal settings. We may also share
      this information with our advertising partners to enable the technical
      delivery of personalized ads to your device, as further described below
      [LINK TO INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING SECTION].
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>User ID:</u> When you register to use the Services, we create a
      unique user ID to track your use of our Services. Specifically, this
      unique user ID is stored in connection with your profile information to
      track the Daily Short Studio apps you are using.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Game Data Collection:</u> We collect gameplay information about how
      you use and play our games. For example, we automatically collect data
      such as your game session time, your in-game interactions (including
      with other players, where applicable), in-app purchases that you may
      make, resource events such as the acquisition or spend of in-game
      virtual currencies by you, progression events that are used to mark your
      progress or movement within the game (e.g. achievements) and install
      timestamps. This information may be associated with your user ID, IP
      address or device ID for the purpose of providing you our Services and
      improving and personalizing them, or to make inferences regarding your
      preferences, predispositions, behavior, abilities and aptitudes. With
      your consent, we will also collect your exact or precise location so
      that we are able to match you with other players in your area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Mobile Analytics:</u> Like most mobile applications, we use mobile
      analytics tools to collect certain information about your usage of our
      mobile applications and games, as well as on your device and the health
      of our Services to allow us to better understand the functionality of
      our Services on your device and for app optimization purposes. Such
      tools may record information such as how often you use the application
      or game, feature usage, gameplay and usage statistics, events that occur
      within the application or game, aggregated usage and performance data,
      and where the application or game was downloaded from (i.e. which
      application store).
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to
      any information that personally identifies you within the mobile
      application.

    <h2>
      Our Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information Automatically
    </h2>
    <p class="bold">A. Tracking Technologies</p>
    <p>
      We and our third party partners, affiliates, or analytics service
      providers use standard tracking technologies (like web beacons, SDKs,
      APIs, scripts and tags) to identify your computer/device, to “remember”
      things about your visit or your use of the Services (such as your
      preferences or a user name) and to help us understand things like, what
      pages and features you use and the games you play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such information may be linked to or combined with other personal
      information we process about you, such as your user ID, for purposes
      such as improving the quality of our Services, tailoring recommendations
      to your interests, providing and personalizing our Services including
      making our Services easier to use, and for fraud prevention, security
      and authentication purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please refer to guidance provided by your device manufacturer, operating
      system developer, or individual web browser if you would like help in
      managing your preferences with respect to tracking technologies used on
      our Services.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">B. Interest-Based Advertising</p>
    <p>
      Some of our Services employ ad-serving technologies that use cookies,
      clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies
      to deliver interest-based advertising to you about third party products
      and services. We may via our third party advertising partners, also
      advertise our Services to you on third parties’ websites. You may also
      see our games advertised in other services (like on Facebook). After
      clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you
      will become a user of our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you play our games or otherwise use our apps, some third party
      tools (SDKs) integrated within our Services may collect and use certain
      information collected from your device for the purpose of ad display and
      optimization. Such information includes GAID (Google Advertising ID on
      Android devices) or IDFA (Identifier for Advertising on iOS devices),
      region (i.e. the location where a given language is used), geo-location
      information (with your consent) and IP address. This Policy does not
      govern our third-party advertising partners, as they have their own
      privacy policies, which are accessible using the links provided below.
      We have no access to or control over such third parties. In addition to
      identifiers, these third parties may also collect information relating
      to:
    </p><ul>
      <li>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;</li>
      <li>Length of time an advertisement was visible;</li>
      <li>Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and</li>
      <li>Click-throughs (i.e. whether a click was made on the ad) and advertisement response.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      They use this information (alone or in combination with information they have collected about you when you use
      third party websites or services) to: (i) enable the technical delivery of ads to your device and to verify
      click-throughs and/or installs; (ii) provide you with more relevant ads about our Services (for example, to
      present you with an offer for one of our games you might enjoy); (iii) enable offer walls, which allow you to
      choose from various rewarded ad or market research offers; (iv) track results and measure the effectiveness of
      ads; and (iv) improve the accuracy of their targeting and measurement systems. We recommend that you review our
      advertising partners' privacy policies for more information, further details of which are set out below:

      and the webpages for&nbsp;<u>Facebook's ad preferences tool</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<u>privacy policy</u>. Similarly, you can learn
      about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings
      and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device. For more information about how to change these

    <p>
      Please note: adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive
      advertisements, it only means the ads you do see will be less relevant to your interests. Our advertising partners
      will also still use your device’s advertising ID to serve you with ads that may be less relevant to you; for
      example, we may use this for frequency capping (in other words, to control the maximum number of times you see the
      same ad from us). You may also reset the Advertising ID associated with your device by following instructions
      provided by your device manufacturer or operating system developer.
    </p>
    <p class="bold">C. Analytics Technologies</p>
    <p>We use our own game servers and third party analytic technologies to collect information about how you use our
      Services, your computer or device and the health of our Services. </p>
    <p>For instance, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre
      Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), on our Services. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking
      technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Services, compile reports on the Services’
      activity
      , and provide other services related to our Services’ activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may
      collect information such as your IP address, time of visit and whether you are a return visitor. The Services do
      not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google
      Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies. To learn
      more about Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">partner services</a> and to learn
      how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google,
      click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For our mobile apps and games on iOS and Android, we use the services of Adjust GmbH (Saarbrücker Str. 37a, 10405
      Berlin, Germany). We use the Adjust SDK (Software Development Kit) which is an analytics service that provides us
      the ability to obtain and collect statistical data on the usage of our games and apps so that we can better
      understand how our users are using our games and apps. For this purpose, Adjust processes mobile identifiers such
      as the IDFA, GAID or similar mobile identifiers. Adjust's privacy policy is available <a href="https://www.adjust.com/terms/privacy-policy/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because there is not yet a common understanding
      of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals. However, we
      provide you with the ability to opt-out of the use of tracking technologies to send you interest-based advertising
      as explained above.</p>

    <p>We collect and use personal information for the business and commercial purposes as described in the section "How

      serving ads that are more relevant, for ad campaign measurement and analytics, and for ad fraud detection and
      reporting. The information collected by our partners include GAID (Google Advertising ID on Android devices) or
      IDFA (Identifier for Advertising on iOS devices), region (i.e. the location where a given language is used),
      geo-location information (with your consent) and IP address. For more information or to opt out of the use of your

    <h3>Your Privacy Rights </h3>
    <p>Under the CCPA, California residents have the following rights:
    </p><ul>
      <li><u>Right to Know:</u> You have the right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have
        collected, used and disclosed over the past 12 months, and information about our data practices;</li>

        we have collected from you;</li>

      </li>
      <li><u>Right to Opt-Out of Sales:</u> We do not sell personal information, so we do not have an opt-out.</li>
      <li><u>Right to be Notified of Financial Incentives:</u> You have the right to be notified of any financial
        incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be

        this time. </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>California law also permits you to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your personal
      information by us and our related companies to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We
      do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently
      respond to "Do Not Track" signals. However, we provide you with the ability to opt-out of the use of tracking
      technologies to send you interest-based advertising as explained above.</p>
    <p>To exercise any of the above rights, or if you are an agent authorized to exercise a right under the CCPA, you

      In some cases, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as a government issued
      ID.</p>
    <p>Under the CCPA, you may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these
      requests on your behalf. We may request that your authorized agent have written permission from you to make
      requests on your behalf and may need to verify your authorized agent’s identity.</p>
